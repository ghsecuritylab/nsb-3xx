Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon - binary kernel module
 Libreswan is an IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It can use the
 native IPsec stack as well as the KLIPS kernel module. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2
 protocols are supported.
 .
 For support of the old-style KLIPS ipsecX network interfaces a custom
 kernel module is needed.
 .
 This package contains the Libreswan binary kernel module for the Linux
 kernel version $KVERS.
 .
 Kernel versions >= 2.6.23 no longer need to be patched to provide NAT
 Traversal support for KLIPS.
