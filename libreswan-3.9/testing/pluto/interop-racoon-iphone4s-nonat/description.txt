This test is based on xauth-pluto-12

This test has a road warrior, ("road") which is using racoon trying to immitate
and iphone. It's configuration is based on an iphone 4s iOS5, using "Cisco IPsec"
mode with certificate.

certificate installed (on real iphone) by publishing the CA pem and PKCS#12
on a website and downloading them both via safari to install.

This test depends on the installation of racoon from the ipsec-tools package


It shows up from a random IP.

It uses PSK to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It then uses MODECFG to configure the phase 2, in server push mode.
It then sends DNS and WINS servers using modecfgdns1,modecfgdn2,modecfgwins1
and modecfgwins2.

NOTE: Some clients require that for these messages IV from phase2, not phase1
is used. We need to turn that into an option.

It then proceeds to phase 2.
