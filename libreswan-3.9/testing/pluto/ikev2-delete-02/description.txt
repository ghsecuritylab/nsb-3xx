This test is part of the ikev2-delete suite to track deletion commands between peers.

02 - west initiates, west uses ipsec whack --deletestate 1 and 2.

Right now east does not send a delete notification to west. When this is fixed
we can change the pass result.

[Regression since RHEL openswan-2.6.32-20]
