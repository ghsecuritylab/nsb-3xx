.SH "NAME"
dbd \- CNID database maintenance
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBdbd\fR\fB\fR\ 'u
\fBdbd\fR\fB\fR [\-evx] {\-d\ [\-i]  | \-s\ [\-c|\-n]  | \-r\ [\-c|\-f|\-C]  | \-u} \fIvolumepath\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdbd\fR
can dump, scan, reindex and rebuild
\fINetatalk\fR
dbd CNID databases\&. It must be run with appropiate permissions i\&.e\&. as root\&.
\fBdbd\fR
\fB\-s|\-r\fR
can be run on active volumes, but
\fBdbd \-rf\fR, which wipes the db before rebuilding it, checks and enforces that the chosen volume is not in use\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Dump CNID database\&. With
\fB\-i \fRdump indexes too\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Scan volume:
.sp
Compare CNIDs in database with volume, test if \&.AppleDouble directories exist, test if AppleDouble files exist, report orphaned AppleDouble files, report directories inside \&.AppleDouble directories, check name encoding, heck for orphaned CNIDs in database (requires
\fB\-e\fR)\&.
.sp
Options:
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
Don\'t check \&.AppleDouble stuff, only check orphaned\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n
.RS 4
Don\'t open CNID database, skip CNID checks, only traverse filesystem
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Rebuild volume:
.sp
Sync CNIDSs from database with volume, ensure \&.AppleDouble directories exist, ensure AppleDouble files exist, delete orphaned AppleDouble files, report directories inside \&.AppleDouble directories, check name encoding by roundtripping, delete orphaned CNIDs in database (requires
\fB\-e\fR)\&.
.sp
Options:
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Converts volume from adouble:v2 to adouble:ea
.RE
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
Don\'t create \&.AppleDouble stuff, only cleanup orphaned\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
Wipe database and rebuild from IDs stored in AppleDouble files, only available for volumes without
\fBnocnidcache\fR
option\&. Implies
\fB\-e\fR\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Upgrade:
.sp
Opens the database which triggers any necessary upgrades, then closes and exits\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
Only work on inactive volumes and lock them (exclusive)
.RE
.PP
\-x
.RS 4
Rebuild indexes (just for completeness, mostly useless!)
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
verbose
.RE
.SH "WARNING"
.PP
In order to be able to run
\fB\-rf\fR
reconstructing the CNIDs in the database from the
\fIAppleDouble\fR
files, make sure you\'ve run a
\fB\-r\fR
rebuild sometimes before, where the CNIDs then would have been synched between database and
\fIAppleDouble\fR
files\&.
.PP
Also be careful about the option
\fBnocnidcache\fR\&. Avoid this option if at all possible, because if prevents you from being able to use
\fB\-f\fR\&.
.SH "CNID BACKGROUND"
.PP
The CNID backends maintains name to ID mappings\&. If you change a filename outside afpd(8) (shell, samba), the CNID db will not know and not reflect that change\&. Netatalk tries to recover from such inconsistencies as gracefully as possible\&. The mechanisms to resolve such inconsistencies may fail sometimes, though, as this is not an easy task to accomplish\&. E\&.g\&. if several names in the path to the file or directory have changed, things may go wrong\&.
.PP
If you change a lot of filenames at once, chances are higher that the afpds fallback mechanisms fail, i\&.e\&. files will be assigned new IDs, even though the file hasn\'t changed\&.
