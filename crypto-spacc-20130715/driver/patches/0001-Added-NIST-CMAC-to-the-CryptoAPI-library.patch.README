This patch adds NIST CMAC to the CryptoAPI stack and also adds CMAC-96 to the IPsec stack.  It applies cleanly 
against 3.7.0-rc6 and will apply against older kernels with the exception of one file:

include/uapi/linux/pfkeyv2.h

is found at:

include/linux/pfkeyv2.h

In Kernels prior to v3.7.0.

You can apply it to a clean source tree with:

patch -p 1 < 0001-Added-NIST-CMAC-to-the-CryptoAPI-library.patch
