	  This selects the instruction set architecture of your Ubicom32 CPU. This
	  information is used for optimizing purposes. To build a library that
	  will run on any Ubicom32 CPU, you can specify "v3" here.
	  If you pick anything other than "v3," there is no
	  guarantee that uClibc will even run on anything other than the
	  selected processor type.

	  You should probably select the Ubicom32 ISA that best matches the
	  CPU you will be using on your device. uClibc will be tuned
	  for that architecture.

	  If you don't know what to do, choose "v3"
