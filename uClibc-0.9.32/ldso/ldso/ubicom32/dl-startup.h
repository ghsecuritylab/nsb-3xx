/* Any assembly language/system dependent hacks needed to setup
 * boot1.c so it will work as expected and cope with whatever platform
 * specific wierdness is needed for this architecture.

 * We override the default _dl_boot function, and replace it with a
 * bit of asm.  Then call the real _dl_boot function, which is now
 * named _dl_boot2.  */

/* At program start-up, p0 contains a pointer to a
   elf32_fdpic_loadmap that describes how the executable was loaded
   into memory.  p1 contains a pointer to the interpreter (our!)
   loadmap, if there is an interpreter, or 0 if we're being run as an
   executable.  p2 holds a pointer to the interpreter's dynamic
   section, if there is an interpreter, or to the executable's dynamic
   section, otherwise.  If the executable is not dynamic, gr18 is 0.

   We rely on the fact that the linker adds a pointer to the
   _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ as the last ROFIXUP entry, and that
   __self_reloc returns the relocated pointer to us, so that we can
   use this value to initialize the PIC register.  */


/*
 *  _dl_boot is the entry point for ldso.
 *
 * The kernel leaves the main apps args on the stack (positive offsets), and
 * communicates the load maps as follows
 *
 * - d1 is set to the exec_map_addr (struct elf32_fdpic_loadmap *), which is the
 *   current state of the mapped application.
 *
 * - d2 is set to interp_map_addr (struct elf32_fdpic_loadmap *), which is use
 *    by ldso to relocate itself.
 *
 * - d3 is dynamic_addr which as far as I can tell is the stack pointer.
 *
 * - a1 is set to zero and will later be initialised to ldso _dl_fini funcdesc
